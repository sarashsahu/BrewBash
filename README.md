# BrewBash

## 🎮 About the Game

BrewBash is a simple yet addictive browser-based game where you navigate a car on a winding road, dodging obstacles (represented as beer bottles) and collecting health pickups (hearts). The game challenges your reflexes as the speed increases with your score. Be careful though, hitting too many obstacles will lead to a game over\! Compete for the highest score, with weekly leaderboards adding an extra layer of challenge.

## ✨ Features

  * **Responsive Car Controls:** Use keyboard arrows/A/D keys or touch controls on mobile to steer your car.
  * **Dynamic Speed:** The game's speed increases as your score goes up, offering a progressive challenge.
  * **Health System:** Avoid obstacles to maintain your health, or look out for health pickups to recover.
  * **High Score Leaderboard:** Compete with yourself and others\! Your top 10 scores are saved locally and reset weekly for fresh competition.
  * **Interactive HUD:** Keep track of your **Score**, **Speed (km/h)**, and **Health (%)** in real-time.
  * **Sound Effects:** Engaging sound effects for crashes, pickups, and game over.
  * **Pause/Play/Restart:** Full control over the game flow.

## 🚀 How to Play

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the game files to your local machine.
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

      * **Touch (Mobile):** Touch and drag left or right on the canvas to steer.
